<title>Using DITA for Technical Documentation</title>
<h1>What is DITA?</h1>
    <p>DITA or Darwin Information Typing Architecture is an open standard for authoring topic-based documents.  Instead of designing each document with its own structure like in Word or HTML, DITA has a strict structure. Documents are modular and made up of many individual topics.</p>
    <p>There are five topic types each with their own structure:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Task</dt>
        <dd>Steps for how to do something.</dd>

        <dt>Concept</dt>
        <dd>Description of an important concept.</dd>

        <dt>Reference</dt>
        <dd>Reference information that is important for understanding other topics.</dd>

        <dt>Glossary</dt>
        <dd>Definitions of terms that can be linked to in other topics </dd>

        <dt>Troubleshooting </dt>
        <dd>Steps for solving problems users encounter while following documentation.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Instead of writing on a single document each topic is its own file. Topics are reused and organized in multiple ways depending on the context that the information is being used.</p>
<h1>Why Use DITA?</h1>
    <p>I suggested using DITA at my work because our Word document had grown to be over 100 pages. It was cumbersome to make updates and slow for us to work on it at the same time using a cloud-based editor. It is a lot of work to migrate such a large document into XML but it is still cost effective because documentation needs to be updated frequently for a long time. I have found many reasons why topic-based authoring is effective for technical documentation.</p>
<h2>Maintaining a Uniform Document Style on a Project with Multiple Authors</h2>

    <p>Unlike with the word and HTML, DITA has a very strict document structure. Each topic is organized in a very specific way and cannot be published in another format unless it is structured correctly. I am using the default topic types but organizations can create custom structures. I can also apply styling rules for the entire document by using DITA properties and CSS. Ideally all authors should adhere to a style guide but with DITA they must order information in a set way. </p>
<h2>Modularity</h2>

    <figcaption>Fig.2 Each Of these files contains the steps for a single task</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>DITA is modular. Each DITA document is made up of many DITA topics that are organized into a DITA map.  This is incredibly useful when documentation covers the same topics for multiple products or languages. Instead of wasting time rewriting similar content or copy/pasting content information is reorganized using a new DITA map. This also means that the structure of the whole document is flexible and different ways of organizing information can be experimented with. DITA maps also have a strict structure so all the table of contents or site maps will follow the same style as well.</p>
<h2>Resource Management</h2>

  </figure>
    <p>DITA allows for easy reuse of resources like images, videos, or frequently referenced links.  Instead of directly referencing resources within a document resources and topics can be indirectly reference using a key. Keys are defined in DITA maps.  If multiple products use the same instructions but need different pictures the keys can be redefined without having to change anything in those topics.</p>
<h2>Publishing in multiple formats</h2>
    <p>DITA is a standard for organizing information that is outputted to multiple formats. This means that a single repository of topics uses multiple formats while maintaining the same style. I think this is especially useful for HTML because authors can create consistent HTML that web designers can then edit or style easily.</p>
